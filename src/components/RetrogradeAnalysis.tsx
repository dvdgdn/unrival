      <h3>0) Purpose & Framing</h3>
      <p>Reconstruct, in reverse, the minimum necessary and jointly sufficient events that lead from early Q3-2025 to the observed 2027 state described for Unrival—a dual-meaning movement (“outperform” and “undo rivalry”) and platform that proves outcomes using a Promise Protocol. Synthesis integrates Systems Thinking, Theory of Constraints (TOC), Marketing/Memetics, NLP/Coaching craft, and Sociology/Governance.</p>

      <h3>1) Observed End-State (Q3 2027): What must be true “there”</h3>
      <h4>1.1 Core Facts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Movement + platform:</strong> “Unrival/Unrivalry” is mainstream language and infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Matching market:</strong> Goal-setters ↔ goal-assistants (hypnotists + allied coaches/mentors/tutors) matched on risk-adjusted outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof layer:</strong> Append-only Promise Registry with cryptographic receipts; attesters (clinics, HR teams, educators, city clerks) verify evidence. No token/e-money required.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare & enterprise:</strong> Hypnosis recognized as adjunct; “promise integrity” used in performance hygiene.</li>
        <li><strong>Civic overlay:</strong> Commitment Ballot format in multiple cities—pledges encoded as promises; live Promise Meter dashboards.</li>
        <li><strong>Globalized quickly, adapted locally:</strong> City-anchored chapters and partner orgs customize promise templates and norms.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>1.2 2027 Reference KPIs (illustrative ranges)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>KPw (Kept-Promises/week):</strong> 140k–200k</li>
        <li><strong>GCR (Goal Completion Rate = kept/total):</strong> 62–70%</li>
        <li><strong>PIS (Promise Integrity Score = % with pre-declared evidence & on-time adjudication):</strong> ≥92%</li>
        <li><strong>Audit pass-rate:</strong> ≥95%</li>
        <li><strong>Equity gap (GCR disadvantaged − advantaged):</strong> ≥−5pp (gap largely closed)</li>
        <li><strong>Cooperation Index (cross-referrals/hand-offs per case):</strong> ≥0.35</li>
        <li><strong>Cities using Commitment Ballots:</strong> 12–20</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) Causal Engine (why the path was necessary)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary 2025 constraint:</strong> Market skepticism about coaching/inner work efficacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Atomic unit of proof:</strong> A promise—Time-bound, Observable, Minimal, Testable (TOMT)—with pre-declared evidence, named observers/devices, deadlines, receipts, and public status.</li>
        <li><strong>Flywheel:</strong> Proof → Trust → Adoption → More Proof, synchronized by TOC (DBR cadence; throughput = KPw).</li>
        <li><strong>Paradigm shift:</strong> From zero-sum rivalry to Unrivalry (win without an enemy), reinforced by non-rivalrous goals (NRGs).</li>
        <li><strong>Governance on time:</strong> Ethics, privacy tiers, audits, and ombud to prevent Goodharting/coercion—unlocking clinical, corporate, and civic adoption.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3) Protocol & Metrics (design that enabled the flywheel)</h3>
      <h4>3.1 Promise Protocol v1.0 (open standard)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Schema (TOMT):</strong> actor, goal, evidence_sources[] (device/app logs, human attesters, artifacts), observers/witnesses, deadline, privacy_tier (default Public status / Private evidence), consequence (renegotiate/reset/donate), attesters[], difficulty_score, version, receipt (hash+timestamp).</li>
        <li><strong>Statuses:</strong> Kept, Renegotiated (versioned), Broken, Withdrawn.</li>
        <li><strong>Receipts:</strong> Tamper-evident event history; edits versioned with reason codes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>3.2 Integrity & Anti-Gaming Controls</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Assignment randomness within risk bands to blunt cherry-picking.</li>
        <li>Difficulty weighting (Elo-like) to risk-adjust helper reputation.</li>
        <li>Random audits 2–5% baseline; up to 15% on anomaly flags.</li>
        <li>Attester reputation (with slashing/delisting for fraud).</li>
        <li>Pre-registration of analyses; denominators public; show broken as well as kept.</li>
        <li>Quarterly red-team drills; publish findings.</li>
        <li>GDPR-first privacy: Public status, private evidence by default; consent layers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>3.3 Measurement Stack</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>KPw:</strong> Kept-Promises per week (primary throughput).</li>
        <li><strong>GCR:</strong> kept/total promises.</li>
        <li><strong>PIS:</strong> % promises with pre-declared evidence and on-time adjudication.</li>
        <li><strong>Audit pass-rate.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Equity delta:</strong> GCR gap across priority cohorts.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooperation Index:</strong> cross-referrals/hand-offs per case.</li>
        <li><strong>NRG Index:</strong> per-capita kept civic/learning promises.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4) Backcast Timeline with Quarterly Targets (2027 → 2025)</h3>
      <p><em>Each slice lists observable milestones and KPI targets that must have existed earlier to support the next layer.</em></p>
      <h4>4.1 Q3 2027 (Jul–Sep 2027) — Consolidation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Civic:</strong> 12–20 cities run Commitment Ballots; Promise Meters live.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> 3–5 insurers reimburse promise-audited adjunct programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Ecosystem:</strong> SDK v3; ≥200 third-party apps writing to registry.</li>
        <li><strong>KPIs:</strong> KPw 140k–200k · GCR 62–70% · PIS ≥92% · Audit ≥95% · Cities 12–20.</li>
        <li><strong>Requires:</strong> Mature attester pools, governance & ethics at scale, media literacy around Unrivalry.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>4.2 Q1–Q2 2027 — Evidence Crest & Political Translation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Evaluations:</strong> Pre-registered reports show 20–40% higher kept-rates with hypnosis-assisted cohorts (sleep onset, study adherence, job search reps).</li>
        <li><strong>Civic:</strong> 4–6 pilot cities adopt pledge dashboards; one mayoral victory on a promise slate; overlay is nonpartisan process.</li>
        <li><strong>KPIs:</strong> KPw 100k–150k · GCR 60–68% · PIS ≥90% · Audit ≥94% · Cities 4–6.</li>
        <li><strong>Requires:</strong> Protocol v1 in production, attesters fielded, Ethics v1 operational.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>4.3 Q3–Q4 2026 — Tipping Point & Backlash Metabolized</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Viral spread:</strong> #KeptInPublic challenge; case-card UGC scales acquisition.</li>
        <li><strong>Backlash:</strong> Coercion/surveillance critiques hit mainstream.</li>
        <li><strong>Response:</strong> Ethics Charter v1.0 (do-no-harm defaults, employer guardrails, ombud, opt-out, red-team audits).</li>
        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Assistant Academy (micro-credentials tied to risk-adjusted outcomes); increased audit capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>KPIs:</strong> KPw 25k–35k → 60k–90k; PIS ≥88–90%; Audit ≥93%; Cooperation Index ≥0.25.</li>
        <li><strong>Requires:</strong> DBR ops humming; attestation pool; dashboards “good enough.”</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>4.4 Q1–Q2 2026 — Protocol Hardens; First Institutional Wins</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Promise Protocol v1.0 + SDK v1 (open schema, receipts).</li>
        <li><strong>Ops:</strong> DBR formalized (Drum = weekly cohort intakes; Buffer = audit/dispute capacity ≥110% of expected verifications; Rope = inflow throttle). Constraint migration managed: demand → verification → assistant capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Institutional pilots:</strong> Fortune-500 department shows promise integrity outpredicts OKRs; university lab releases open-methods cohort analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>KPIs:</strong> KPw 5k–7.5k → 12k–18k; GCR 56–62%; PIS ≥85%.</li>
        <li><strong>Requires:</strong> Pilot effect sizes; independent methods/ethics advisory board; privacy tiers working.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>4.5 Q3–Q4 2025 — Founding Wedge & Credibility Unlock</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MVP:</strong> Matching + public micro-registry; short-horizon wedges: sleep onset (wearables), smoking cessation (CO monitors).</li>
        <li><strong>Offer:</strong> Risk-reversal (“pay on kept”) on tightly scoped promises.</li>
        <li><strong>Community:</strong> Weekly Dialogos & Design calls; memetics: Un/rival, “Outperform your past. Outgrow rivalry.”</li>
        <li><strong>KPIs:</strong> KPw 150–300 → 800–1,200; GCR 52–58%; PIS ≥80%; 1,000–3,000 total promises; 2–3 pilots (community college, workforce office).</li>
        <li><strong>Requires:</strong> Hypnosis as the first domino; strict TOMT promise design; public denominators.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5) Operations & Scaling (TOC/DBR)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective function:</strong> Maximize KPw subject to PIS ≥ threshold and audit pass ≥ threshold.</li>
        <li><strong>Drum:</strong> Weekly cohort intakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Buffer:</strong> Verification & dispute-resolution capacity sized at ≥110% expected verifications; leading indicator = PIS trend.</li>
        <li><strong>Rope:</strong> Controlled release of new users/domains to prevent buffer starvation/overwhelm.</li>
        <li><strong>Constraint migration plan:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Demand → gate marketing spend by PIS ≥80%.</li>
            <li>Verification → expand attesters; automate device-evidence ingestion.</li>
            <li>Assistant capacity → Academy, supervision loops, outcome-tied credentialing.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6) Marketing & Memetics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brand duality:</strong> “Unrivaled ≠ rivals; rivalry unraveled.” The ambiguity is functional, not decorative.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof storytelling:</strong> Case cards (anonymized receipts) as UGC; NRG leaderboards emphasize public goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> #KeptInPublic with low-friction starter promises; messaging focuses on alignment (not grindset).</li>
        <li><strong>Narrative capsule:</strong> “Promise. Proceed. Prove. Outperform your past. Outgrow rivalry.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7) NLP/Coaching Craft</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Why hypnosis first:</strong> Enables fast, experiential shifts on short-horizon behaviors—ideal for early TOMT promises.</li>
        <li><strong>Assistant skill-set:</strong> rapport, induction, parts work, suggestion design, promise craft, ethics, measurement literacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality loop:</strong> Outcome-tied micro-credentials; supervision with promise tree reviews; risk-adjusted reputation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8) Sociology & Governance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ethics Charter v1.0:</strong> do-no-harm defaults; employer coercion ban; age/consent protections; data minimization; public audit log for paid interventions; independent ombud.</li>
        <li><strong>Open protocol / plural governance:</strong> Foundation stewards the protocol; B-corp runs matching; local charters enable city-anchored chapters.</li>
        <li><strong>Civic translation:</strong> Commitment Ballot is a non-partisan process overlay; quarterly delivery reviews; replication by competitors (institutional isomorphism) by 2027.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9) Branching Scenarios (probabilities, triggers, actions)</h3>
      <h4>Measured Glidepath (p≈0.55)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> PIS ≥85% by Q2-2026; audit ≥93%; ≥1 city pilot signed.</li>
        <li><strong>Actions:</strong> Expand SDK; scale attesters; prepare 5–8 city MOUs; broaden NRG campaigns.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Backlash Spike (p≈0.30)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Negative press cluster; complaint rate &gt; X/1k users; enrollment dip after viral challenge.</li>
        <li><strong>Actions:</strong> Freeze employer-facing features; publish Ethics v1.0 + red-team post-mortem; shift challenges from self-optimization to NRGs; raise audit rates on flagged categories.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Verification Bottleneck (p≈0.15)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Verification backlog &gt;10 days; PIS &lt;80% for 2+ weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Actions:</strong> Tighten Rope; surge-hire attesters; prioritize device-evidence domains; defer new categories.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Stop/continue gate (myopic VOI):</strong> Expand a domain only when EVSI − added cost &gt; 0 with a 95% CI excluding 0.</p>

      <h3>10) Early Signals & Falsification Tests (Q3–Q4 2025)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Methods signals:</strong> Pre-registered cohorts; denominators public; kept and broken shown.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketplace health:</strong> Week-4 retention ≥60%; KPw ≥150 by month 2.</li>
        <li><strong>Equity:</strong> +5pp GCR improvement in priority cohorts vs. baseline.</li>
        <li><strong>Governance:</strong> Ethics draft + named advisory board before first major press cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Civic traction:</strong> At least one MOU clause with a city/school citing promise-tracked delivery.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11) 90-Day Action Plan (from early Q3-2025)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ship Protocol Draft v0.1 + micro-registry:</strong> statuses, receipts, privacy tiers; static site acceptable.</li>
        <li><strong>Run two 12-week cohorts:</strong> Sleep onset & Job search; pre-register; publish warts and all.</li>
        <li><strong>Stand up Assistant Academy (≈20 hours):</strong> rapport/induction/parts/suggestion; promise craft; ethics; badge tied to outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Form attester pool (10–20):</strong> clinics, HR, educators; SOPs & reputation scoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Comms:</strong> Un/rival manifesto; case-card gallery; #KeptInPublic v0.1; “no miracles—just promises kept.”</li>
        <li><strong>Ops (DBR):</strong> Throughput dashboard; Rope throttle; weekly post-mortems.</li>
        <li><strong>90-day targets:</strong> 1,500–3,000 promises; KPw 300–600; GCR 54–60%; PIS ≥80%; Audit ≥90%; ≥1 civic stakeholder exploring a pilot.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>12) Sample Artifacts (user-level & civic)</h3>
      <ArtifactBox title="Promise Receipt (human-readable)">
        Actor: Amina K.<br />
        Goal: 20 × 45-min B2 German sessions by 15 Dec 2025<br />
        Evidence: Focus-app logs + calendar + 2 peer check-ins/week<br />
        Assistant: Marta (hypnosis-informed study coach)<br />
        Privacy: Public status / Private evidence<br />
        Consequence: Renegotiate to 30-min blocks if &lt;3 sessions/week ×2 weeks<br />
        Status: Kept (22 sessions) — Receipt: 0x…c91 (timestamp) — Attesters: Lea S., Omar R.
      </ArtifactBox>
      <ArtifactBox title="City Pledge (civic NRG)">
        Repair 50 playground hazards by 30 Mar 2026<br />
        Evidence: work orders + photo verifications; observers: neighborhood councils; dashboard auto-updates<br />
        Status: Renegotiated → Kept (52 repairs; timeline extended 10 days with versioned reason code)
      </ArtifactBox>

      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>Starting from the 2027 facts, the only robust path back to Q3-2025 is: prove outcomes at the smallest unit (promises), protect integrity with protocol + governance, scale with TOC discipline, package the behavior in a meme that travels, and translate the same grammar from people to cities. This document enumerates the milestones, numbers, controls, and forks that make that path both necessary and sufficient.</p>

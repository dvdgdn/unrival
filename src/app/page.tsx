  <strong>About this exercise:</strong> This isn't a predictionâ€”it's a thought experiment. 
  We're exploring what might be possible if certain approaches to trust and commitment 
  actually worked at scale. Think of it as "what if we got our act together?" rather 
  than "here's what will happen."

          <h2>The &quot;Retrograde Analysis&quot; Technique</h2>
          <p>
            A vision is inspiring, but it is not a plan. Retrograde analysis is the technique of
            working backward from a future success to map the critical path that leads to it. If the
            letter is the &quot;destination,&quot; this analysis is the &quot;map.&quot; Instead of
            asking &quot;What do we do next?&quot;, ask, &quot;For our future vision to be true, what
            must have already happened the year before?&quot;
          </p>
